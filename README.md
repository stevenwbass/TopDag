## Features
* Check for path existence
* Cycle detection
* Topological sorting
* Satisfiability graph
* Extensible -- inherit/override existing classes as you see fit

## Goals
* Provide algorithm for graph traversal with arbitrary operations at each node/edge visit (with cumulative state).
* Examples

Based on [ociaw's Dagger](https://github.com/ociaw/dagger).
