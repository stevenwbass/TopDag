# TopDag
A library targeting .NET Standard implementing a basic Directed Acyclic Graph. In addition to algorithms for checking path existence, cycle detection, and topologocal sorting, provides extensibility hooks for traversing the DAG and performing arbitrary operations at each node/edge visit (with cumulative state). Based on ociaw's Dagger.
